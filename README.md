- Gameplay

There are 4 "levels" situated around the forest where there's 4 treasure chests located inside of locked dungeons. You can only open said dungeons with the help of a key, which are also placed around the map. Keys are able to unlock both doors and the treasure chests. The lava paths must be avoided or else the player will respawn to the starting point. Power-ups such as "Grape Juice" and "Watermelon Juice" allow the player to speed up and temporarily walk on water. However, there's a catch. For every Watermelon Juice consumed, in 10 seconds the player will pass out and respawn at the starting point due to the side-effects of drinking strange liquids that allow water-walking. You can still move around after passing out! The game ends when all four treasure chests have been found and unlocked.

This game was developed using Java and JFrame with required appropriate Java classes and Java AWT. The process of developing this game was greatly gratifying and allowed me to further delve into the intricacies of Java's object-oriented programming and abstraction of classes, which are some of the most fundamental concepts of programming. I designed and created the world map, tiles, and character sprites using the online platform "Piskel", tile dimensions: 48 x 48.
