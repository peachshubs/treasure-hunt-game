## 🎮 Gameplay

- **Levels & Chests**  
  There are 4 levels situated across the forest. Each level contains a treasure chest inside a locked dungeon.  
  - Keys scattered around the map are used to unlock **both doors and treasure chests**.

- **Obstacles**  
  - **Lava Paths:** Avoid them! Or else you'll respawn at the starting point.  
  - **Wide Rivers:** Navigate carefully to reach your goal (find power-ups to help!)

- **Power-ups**  
  - **Grape Juice:** Speeds up the player temporarily.  
  - **Watermelon Juice:** Allows temporary water-walking but causes the player to **pass out and respawn** after 10 seconds due to side-effects. (Don't drink unknown juices in wild forests!)

- **Objective**  
  Collect all keys, unlock the dungeons, and find all 4 treasure chests to complete the game.
